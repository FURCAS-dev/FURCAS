To avoid forgetting our future plans, I wrote them down here.
If you think these notes are to short or not expressive enough, feel free to add descriptions on your own.

- calculation of leaving scopes
- implementation of the unused() function
- implementation of a factory for UnusedEvaluationRequest (and the nested ones)
- create a shortcut structure for the unused calculation similar to the NavigationSteps used for traceback
- the partial evaluator may be able to treat let variables in a special way as their value might have been inferred by the traceback() function already
- consider shortcut evaluation of Boolean operations (and, or): source/argument of and()/or() is unused if
  argument/source, respectively, is false/true, respectively

/**
 * The instance scope analysis's goal is to compute {@link NavigationStep} objects for each {@link AttributeCallExp} and
 * {@link AssociationEndCallExp} subexpression in an OCL expression's expression tree. These {@link NavigationStep}s can each be a
 * graph, referring to other potentially composite navigation steps. The graph can even be cyclic, as in the case for recursive
 * operation calls.
 * <p>
 * 
 * During the analysis of the <em>traceback</em> paths, for each subexpression visited, the {@link NavigationPath} for that node
 * is stored in this cache.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Don't re-use an instance of this class for analyzing more than one expression when those expressions are dynamically parsed
 * because in those cases, new operation calls are created dynamically which turn existing entries in the {@link PathCache} for
 * <tt>self</tt> and parameter expressions of the operation called invalid. Additionally, all dependent paths would become invalid
 * too. Identifying and removing those entries from a {@link PathCache} seems to cause more effort than using a new
 * {@link PathCache} object for each expression analyzed, particularly given the fact that the {@link NavigationPath} assembly
 * only has to happen once per life-time of an {@link OCLExpression<EClassifier>} during a session.
 *

public class PathCache {
    /**
     * Keys are OCL expressions for which a navigation path is cached, together with a list of tuple part names to be collected
     * during construction of that step. Only if this list is equal during construction then the step can be re-used. Example:
     * <p>
     * 
     * <pre>
     *     let a:Tuple{x1:X=self.myX1, x2:X=self.myX2} in
     *     Set{a.x1, a.x2}->collect(x | x.name)
     * </pre>
     * 
     * If this expression is analyzed for an attribute change event of an <tt>X.name</tt>, the iterator variable <tt>x</tt> is
     * traced back to the collect's source expression which is the collection literal. A branching step is created with one branch
     * for each of its literal parts. Both parts access a tuple part, one the <tt>x1</tt> part, the other the <tt>x2</tt> part of
     * the same tuple. For <tt>a.x1</tt> the tracer pushes "x1" onto the "stack" and constructs a tracer for the <tt>a</tt> source
     * expression. The {@link VariableExpTracer} finds the let expression and constructs the navigation path for the variable's
     * init expression. This, however, is the same {@link TupleLiteralExp} that will be found when tracing back the <tt>a</tt> in
     * <tt>a.x2</tt>. However, the first time the {@link TupleLiteralExpTracer} is constructed, it needs to descend into the
     * <tt>x1</tt> part's init expression whereas for the <tt>a.x2</tt> it needs to descend into <tt>x2</tt>'s init expression.
     * <p>
     * 
     * This shows that a navigation path can only be re-used if the request for its construction has an equal list of tuple
     * literal part names on the "stack" as the one cached.<p>
     * 
     * The <tt>List<String></tt> element of the key pair may be <tt>null</tt>. It <em>must</em> be <tt>null</tt>
     * instead of passing an empty list to avoid ambiguities.

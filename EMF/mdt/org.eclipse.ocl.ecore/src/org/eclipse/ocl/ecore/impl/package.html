Implementation of the Ecore binding of the the <tt>Types</tt> package of the
OCL Abstract Syntax.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package implements the Ecore binding for the <tt>Types</tt> package of the
OCL Abstract Syntax, as specified by the interfaces in the
{@link org.eclipse.ocl.ecore} package.  The types in this
package are not typically used by clients.  Rather, instances of the abstract
syntax classes are created either using the
{@linkplain org.eclipse.ocl.ecore.EcoreFactory factory interface}
or by parsing OCL text.

Abstract API for OCL AST utilities and extensions of the UML metamodel.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
This package defines a number of utility interfaces that are mixed in to the
AST model defined in the {@link org.eclipse.ocl.expressions} and
{@link org.eclipse.ocl.types} packages, as well as UML metamodel extensions and
related services.  These utilities include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a {@link org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.Visitor Visitor} pattern definition</li>
<li>{@linkplain org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.Visitable visitor accept} protocol</li>
<li>tracking from where in the source text an
    {@linkplain org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.ASTNode AST node} was parsed</li>
<li>an emulation of the UML
    {@link org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.TypedElement TypedElement} metaclass</li>
<li>access to the name and operations of the types
    {@linkplain org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.PredefinedType pre-defined} by OCL</li>
</ul>
<p>
These concerns are orthogonal to the definition of the abstract syntax model and
do not affect XMI serialization.
</p>
<p>
This package also defines the {@link org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.ExpressionInOCL}
metaclass that extends the UML <tt>OpaqueExpression</tt> metaclass to support
embedding of OCL expressions in models.
</p>
<p>
Also of note is the {@link org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.UMLReflection} interface
that provides introspection and construction of the model concepts that OCL
re-uses from the UML.  Providers of OCL metamodel bindings (i.e.,
{@link org.eclipse.ocl.Environment}s) are required to implement this interface
to manipulate metaclasses either from the metamodel that they are binding, or
that they define themselves to implement these concepts.

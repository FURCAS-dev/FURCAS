<body lang="EN-US">
<p>
All of the OCL features can be executed outside the Eclipse environment.
This zip file contains the jar files you will need to add to your Java
application's classpath.
</p><p>
OCL can be deployed without the com.ibm.icu (ICU4J) bundle, hence it is not
included in this ZIP.  However, in the absence of ICU4J, J2SE 5.0 is required
for UNICODE support.

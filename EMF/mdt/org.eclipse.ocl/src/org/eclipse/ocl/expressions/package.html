Specification of the <tt>Expressions</tt> package of the Object Constraint Lanuage
version 2.0 Abstract Syntax model.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package defines the API for the structure of parsed OCL expressions, as
described in the <tt>Expressions</tt> package of the OCL specification version
2.0 with some extensions for this parser implementation.  These extensions
include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>implementation of a {@link org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.Visitable Visitable}
      interface to support the <tt>Visitor</tt> pattern for analysis and
      transformation of expressions</li>
  <li>implementation of a {@link org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.ASTNode} and related
      interfaces for tracking the positions in the original input text of the
      various parts of an expression</li>
  <li>implementation of a {@link org.eclipse.ocl.utilities.TypedElement}
      interface to define the name and type properties of expressions and
      variables, inherited by these metaclasses from the UML, EMOF, or
      Core::Basic metamodel respectively for CompleteOCL, EssentialOCL, and
      BasicOCL</li>
</ul>
<p>
None of these extensions of the model affects the XMI serialization of OCL
expressions which, as much as possible, is conformant to the OCL specification.

|A customer may describe the system landscape in an instance of this metamodel. In particular, this describes machines, network infrastructure, as well as software components installed on each of those.
|
|This information can be used to determine a good configuration for a customer, given a selection of solutions that the customer wants. It may also be helpful in tracking and monitoring the landscape. Ideally, landscape configuration scripts could be generated from a selection of components and a plan as to how to distribute the components across the landscape.

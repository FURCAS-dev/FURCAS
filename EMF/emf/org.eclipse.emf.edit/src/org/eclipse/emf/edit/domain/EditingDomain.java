/**
 * An editing domain manages a self-contained set of interrelated EMF models and the {@link Command}s that modify them.
 * The models are maintained in the form of a {@link ResourceSet}.
 * Commands that modify the model are typically created through the domain and are executed using the {@link CommandStack}.
 * An optional feature of an editing domain, which is used to implement mapping domains,
 * is the ability to override primitive commands, see {@link OverrideableCommand}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The domain imposes a hierarchical structure upon the models 
 * via the results of the {@link #getChildren getChildren} and {@link #getParent getParent} methods.
 * This is useful for implementing commands such as 
 * {@link org.eclipse.emf.edit.command.RemoveCommand}, which often needs to deduce the parent from which to remove a particular object,
 * and {@link org.eclipse.emf.edit.command.CopyCommand}, which often needs to deduce all the children to copy recursively.
 * This also meshes well with user interfaces, which often present a model hierarchically, i.e., as a tree.

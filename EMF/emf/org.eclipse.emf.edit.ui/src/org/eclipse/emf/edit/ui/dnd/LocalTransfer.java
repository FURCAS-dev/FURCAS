/**
 * This derived implementation of a byte array transfer short circuits the transfer process
 * so that a local transfer does not serialize the object
 * and hence can and will return the original object, not just a clone.
 * You only really need ever know about {@link #getInstance LocalTransfer.getInstance()},
 * so that you can include it in when adding drag support to a viewer.
 * See {@link EditingDomainViewerDropAdapter} and {@link ViewerDragAdapter} for more details.
 * <p>
 * As an added guard, the time is recorded and serialized in javaToNative
 * to that native to java can ensure that it's returns the value that was really to have been transferred.

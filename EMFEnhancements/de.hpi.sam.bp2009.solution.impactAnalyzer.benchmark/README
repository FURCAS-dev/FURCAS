Readme for Impact Analysis Benchmark Application:

Export a JAR file by using "File --> Export --> Runnable JAR File, selecting the "ImpactAnalysisBenchmarkExtensive.launch"
launch configuration. Call the exported JAR file "benchmark.jar". You can launch a benchmark using

	java -jar benchmark.jar <options>
	
Without <options> it will print the list of available/required options which as of this writing are:

usage: Impact Analysis Benchmark Environment v0.1
 -d,--delayprep <arg>    Delay preparation of benchmark task
                         (true[default]/false)
 -e,--excdump <arg>      An exception dump file will be written to the
                         specified path
 -h,--help               Show this help
 -j,--jobs <arg>         Number of parallel jobs for benchmarking. Default
                         is 1
 -m,--measures <arg>     Number of measurements per benchmark task
                         (required)
 -mp,--modelpath <arg>   Name of serialized model file
 -o,--output <arg>       Output file destination (required)
 -ob,--outbuffer <arg>   Buffer size of output stream
 -sf,--showfiles         Show which trace files and model files are
                         available
 -tp,--tracepath <arg>   Name of tracefile which shall be replayed
 -v,--verbose            Run in verbose mode
 -wu,--warmups <arg>     Number of warm ups before measuring task
                         (required)

Ideally, you will want to give the benchmark lots of memory. Currently, >=6GB are useful, so you may want to launch the VM
using something like, for example,

	java -Xmx26000m -Xms26000m -jar benchmark.jar -o /tmp/20100929/ -wu 3 -m 1 -d true -j 8
	
which will run with 26GB of heap space (don't do this on machines with less than 32GB of physical memory!),
using three warm-up runs, doing one measurement run, not constructing all jobs up-front (-d true) which
saves memory, and runs with eight jobs in parallel (don't do this on machines with fewer than eight cores).
In this example, output will be written to the /tmp/20100929 folder.

The result.data file produced by the benchmark run can be used as input to the R scripts which you find in this
project under

	src/de/hpi/sam/bp2009/solution/impactAnalyzer/benchmark/postprocessing/scripts

An additional HOWTO in that directory explains the steps necessary to post-process the results using
the R statistical analysis framework.

/**
 * Accepts change operations from clients and maintains a shared state. If new
 * clients connect, the full state can be sent to the client for initial
 * synchronization. When a change {@link Operation} is received from a client
 * that operation will be based on some state. Since that state the
 * server may have applied one or more change operations already. In order to
 * synchronize the requesting client, the server transforms all in-between
 * change operations for the requesting client and sends those transformation
 * results back to the requesting client. The client's operation, in turn, is
 * disseminated to all other clients for them to merge into their local replica
 * of the global state.

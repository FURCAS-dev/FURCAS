- Make sure that you have web access via console. 
  (You may have to set a proxy by "export http_proxy=http://proxy.wdf.sap.corp:8080/")
- Open the R console by executing R or R.exe
- Install R packages which are needed in order to run the R scripts within this folder.
  Therefore execute the following lines within the R console: 
   
  install.packages("rgl")
  install.packages("DAAG")
  install.packages("outliers")
  install.packages("lattice")

How to refactor the existing Runlet/River interpreter into an abstract
interpreter that can also be used to implement essential parts of the
FINEX interpreter:

The interpreter objects currently implemented by RiverObject, EntityObject, ValueObject and
MultiValuedObject would remain in place but would need parameterization because their
types will be described by meta-objects coming from the respective metamodel, such as
TypeDefinition, ClassTypeDefinition and FunctionSignatureTypeDefinition in Runlet.

The Repository interface makes reference to ClassTypedObject which according to the above
would remain in place in a parameterized version, and AssociationEnd which has to be
changed into a type parameter because it depends on the metamodel.

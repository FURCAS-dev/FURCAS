package data.timedependency;

/**
 * Models the aspect of time-dependent data. If a structural feature such as a class or a property or an association is marked as time-dependent, clients expect to find time-dependent access operations for read access. If no time is specified, the time of access is implicitly assumed.
 * <p>
 * Modifications to such structures keep the history of the data. Again, if no modification time is explicitly specified, the time at which the modification occurs is used implicitly.
 * <p>
 * Clarify if it should be possible to "modify history." In other words, should it be possible to make structural changes in data that was already recorded in the past?
 * <p>
 * TODO Perhaps this package should be separated out into an own top-level metamodel package because it has dependencies on behavioral/actions and dataaccess/expressions.
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.

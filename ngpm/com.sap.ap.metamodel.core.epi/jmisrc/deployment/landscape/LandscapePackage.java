/**
 * A customer may describe the system landscape in an instance of this metamodel. In particular, this describes machines, network infrastructure, as well as software components installed on each of those.
 * <p>
 * This information can be used to determine a good configuration for a customer, given a selection of solutions that the customer wants. It may also be helpful in tracking and monitoring the landscape. Ideally, landscape configuration scripts could be generated from a selection of components and a plan as to how to distribute the components across the landscape.
 * <p>
 * Landscape components (source: Nestle): OS, DB, Network, middle tier software, business applications (SAP, non-SAP, legacy)
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.

/**
 * Contains model snipplets useful for parts of the programming model that require translation of (parts of) their artifacts, such as UI texts, message texts or descriptions useful during design-time. This may require linking to concepts such as "development language" providing defaults for the language in which a string is given.
 * <p>
 * It will also be an interesting question how the languages, regions and dialects important for the translation process should be represented.
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.

Use the contents of this package for so-called <em>operational transformations</em>.
This can be used to synchronize the states of a number of clients with a single server.
The synchronization is performed asynchronously. The construction of the transformation
function guarantees to lead to eventual consistency across clients and server.
Read more about the general background of the algorithm on which this is based
<a href="../docs/JupiterCollaborationSystem_Nichols.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
To establish a server to which clients can connect, first decide how your <em>state</em>
is encoded on which the <em>operations</em> will perform changes to transition from one
state to the next. Then, design your operations class. The trickiest part comes next. You
have to define a transformer that maps a pair of your operations to another pair of
operations of the same type. The transformer has to implement the
{@link com.sap.runlet.operationaltransformation.Transformer} interface, in particular
the {@link com.sap.runlet.operationaltransformation.Transformer#transform} method. The
transformation function assumes that both input operations have been applied to the same
state, one on a client, the other one on the server. The resulting operation for the client
applied on the client must lead to a state equal to the state reached on the server by
applying the resulting operation for the server to the server's state.
</p>

<p>
Put formally, if <em>t</em> is a transformer, and
if we have <em>s_c</em> as the state on the client and <em>s_s</em> as the state
on the server, and <em>c</em> as the operation that was executed in state <em>s_c</em> on the
client, and <em>s</em> as the operation executed on the server in state <em>s_s</em>, then the
following condition must hold:<br>
<pre>
	t.transform(c, s).getClientOp().applyTo(c.applyTo(s_c).equals(
		t.transform(c, s).getServerOp().applyTo(s.applyTo(s_s))
</pre>
</p>

<p>
You can create servers and clients, e.g., as follows:
<pre>
	server = new {@link com.sap.runlet.operationaltransformation.PeerImpl PeerImpl}<MyOperationType, MyStateType>(
		"Server", new MyTransformer(), /* initial state */ new MyStateType(...), /* server */ true);
	client1 = new {@link com.sap.runlet.operationaltransformation.PeerImpl PeerImpl}<MyOperationType, MyStateType>("Client1", new MyTransformer(), server);
	client2 = new {@link com.sap.runlet.operationaltransformation.PeerImpl PeerImpl}<MyOperationType, MyStateType>("Client2", new MyTransformer(), server);
</pre>

After that, you can start sending operations to the clients using the
{@link com.sap.runlet.operationaltransformation.Peer#apply} method as follows:
<pre>
	client1.{@link com.sap.runlet.operationaltransformation.Peer#apply apply}(new MyOperationType(...));
	client2.{@link com.sap.runlet.operationaltransformation.Peer#apply apply}(new MyOperationType(...));
	...
</pre>
and those changes will eventually get synchronized across all clients and the server. You can
obtain the current state of a peer using the {@link com.sap.runlet.operationaltransformation.Peer#getCurrentState}
operation.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A {@link Repository} is a durable store for objects and the links
between them. It is organized in {@link Snapshot}s, each of which
representing a coherent view of the object and link sets at an atomic
point in time. Snapshots can have a predecessor, meaning they resulted
from applying a set of changes (see {@link ChangeSet}) to the preceding
snapshot. If a snapshot has multiple predecessors, this means it is
considered a merge between two branches. Branching and merging will be a
future topic.</p>

<p>The repository is used by the {@link
com.sap.river.interpreter.RiverInterpreter interpreter} and its {@link
com.sap.river.interpreter.TransactionBuffer}. When the interpreter
starts, it is assigned a repository from where to load and to which to
store data. The interpreter maintains a transaction buffer which records
the changes that the interpreter carried out on persistent data. The
transaction buffer is a special {@link ChangeSet} and can therefore be
applied to a snapshot to produce a new successor snapshot.</p>


<h2>Determining Default Snapshot for Queries</h2>

<p>When the interpreter reads from the repository, it needs to do so
from a given snapshot. Either this snapshot is determined by the
application, asking for data from a specific snapshot, or it defaults to
the "current default" snapshot, something that resembles the "HEAD"
revision on the "trunk" of a versioning repository. (Once branching and
merging is supported, there may also be something like a default branch
for an interpreter. For now, let's assume that the interpreter together
with the repository can determine this "current default" snapshot
somehow.)</p>

<p>Which one is the "current default" snapshot is determined upon the
first access to the repository reading from the "current default"
snapshot. When repository and interpreter have agreed what the "current
default" snapshot is, the interpreter records this and uses the same
snapshot as its "current default" until a <em>commit</em> or a <em>rollback</em>
is performed. With this, all unqualified repository queries will
continue to read from the same snapshot consistently, even if other
interpreters in the meantime create successor snapshots which may be
chosen as "current default" snapshots by other interpreters.</p>


<h2>Determining the Transaction Buffer's Base Snapshot</h2>

<p>As a change set, a transaction buffer contains changes to be
applied to a <em>single</em> snapshot only. Therefore, the interpreter
and the repository need to determine at some point which snapshot
this is. When the interpreter starts out and no interaction with the
repository has yet taken place, this snapshot is not yet determined.
Creation of new entity objects does not change this.</p>

<p>Because an application may explicitly request data from snapshots
other than the "current default" snapshot, it is important to record the
snapshot to which a piece of data---objects and links---pertains.
Therefore, each {@link RepositoryObject} maintains its {@link
RepositoryObject#getOrigin original snapshot}, the snapshot from which
it was loaded or into which it was committed. For objects that are not
meant to be persistently stored, this will be <tt>null</tt>. For objects
that have not yet been committed but which are already marked to be
committed by adding them to the {@link TransactionBuffer} as "created,"
currently it is also <tt>null</tt>, and a request to the {@link
TransactionBuffer} is required to find out if an object is in this
state. (TODO this may need to change, and a more convenient way on a
{@link RepositoryObject} should be provided to find out about its
persistence-related status)</p>


<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>When the interpreter evaluates an association navigation, it does so in
the context of the snapshot of the object at which navigation starts. This also
applies to value objects. The objects reached by the navigation are marked to
belong to the same snapshot as the object on which the navigation started.</p>


<h2>Creating Links</h2>

<p>When a link is created, it connects two class-typed objects. If any of those objects
is a persistent object and the link is relevant for the object's equality,
then the link will also be marked for being stored persistently, meaning it gets
added to the transaction buffer as created link. Regarding the snapshot, the new
link will pertain to the same snapshot as the object on its end that caused
the link to become a persistent link in the first place.</p>

<p>If the object on the other end already belongs to a snapshot, this has to
be the same snapshot as the one the link not belongs to. The invariant is that
a link and the objects at both its ends all either belong to no snapshot or all
to the same snapshot.</p>

<p>If the link is a composite link between two entities, and the parent
entity is a persistent object and the child entity is not yet persistent,
the link will become persistent with the parent's snapshot, and so will
the child entity. Recursively, all link attached to the child entity will
then also be marked as persistent, meaning that those who weren't marked so
before will then be added as "created" in the transaction buffer.</p>

<p>Links may also be created for a persistent association extent between two
value objects if it is not relevant for either value's equality. In this
case the link will be added to whatever the transaction buffer's "new shapshot"
is.</p>


<h2>Deleting Links</h2>

<p>When a persistent link is deleted, this will be signalled to the transaction buffer.
If the link's snapshot is not compatible with the buffer's base snapshot, this
is an error. If the link is composite, the child object and its entire composition
tree with all attached links are considered deleted, too.</p>

<h2>Deleting an Entity</h2>

<p>When a persistent entity is deleted, this is recorded in the transaction buffer.
If the entity's snapshot does not match the buffer's base snapshot, this is considered
an error. After deletion and even after committing the deletion the transient entity
object still exists. However, it doesn't have a snapshot assigned anymore.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>We should be able to tell for a {@link RepositoryObject} whether
or not it is generally "marked for" persistence, already committed or
only transient. For the transient objects, no lookup in the repository
would be required during navigation. With the current setup, the objects
themselves don't contain enough data to decide this. Although the
snapshot is <tt>null</tt>, the object may still be contained in the
{@link TransactionBuffer} as "created." But then again, for those
objects the repository still doesn't know anything about them...</p>

<p>A {@link TransactionBuffer} maintains a snapshot on which it is <em>based</em>.
When applied, it will produce a new snapshot that doesn't exist until
the buffer has successfully been committed. Objects and links marked as
"created" in the transaction buffer will belong to this new snapshot.
Should this snapshot which doesn't exist before the buffer has been
committed, be identifiable and distinguishable from the <tt>null</tt>
snapshot? If we had such a snapshot "placeholder" for the "new"
snapshot, we could assign this already to all newly-created {@link
RepositoryObject}s and by this easily find out about each object's
persistence status. Otherwise, the transaction buffer would always be
required to determine the persistence status of a {@link
RepositoryObject}.</p>

<p>When the transaction buffer has successfully been committed, all
the {@link RepositoryObject}s affected by this commit (created/deleted
objects/links) have to have their snapshot updated. For those deleted,
the snapshot could either be removed meaning that these objects from now
on are considered transient, or the base snapshot could be left
assigned, meaning that they lastly existed in that previous snapshot
that served as the base for applying the transaction buffer.</p>

<p>For all objects/links created the snapshot marker should probably
be set to the snapshot created by the commit. This, however, will change
these objects' Java equality/hashCode, requiring a massive re-hashing in
all structures. It would be cool if this could be avoided. For the
newly-created objects/links, this may work based on the above idea,
using a placeholder snapshot for the "new snapshot" which then after the
commit doesn't change its Java hashCode/equals definition and still
identifies this new snapshot. This, however, would require that objects
loaded from this new snapshot after it has been committed will get
assigned a snapshot object that compares equal and has an equal hashCode
to the virtual "new snapshot" object. This may make a major
indirection/re-keying of snapshots necessary.</p>

<p><b>Problem:</b> When an object/link exists in a snapshot that is the base
of a buffer that now gets committed, the plan is to update the snapshot
identifier to the snapshot resulting from the commit. However, if an auto-merge
took place, changes from other change sets may have happened in between that
may invalidate objects/links and generally parts of the contents of the
link container. Only if the snapshot resulting from the commit is an
immediate successor to the base snapshot, all objects/links and the link container
contents can be assumed to still be consistent, and it is okay to just update
the snapshot identifier that they all use to the snapshot resulting from
the commit. If an auto-merge took place without conflicts, only the changes
from the transaction buffer can be assumed to still be up-to-date. For all
other objects/links the interpreter has to assume that they may have changed
due to some other snapshot having been auto-merged. In this case, the change
set of the snapshots that got incorporated in the merge need to be analyzed
and the objects/links held in memory that are affected by those change sets
need to be invalidated or automatically updated. For example, if an external
snapshot that auto-merged during the commit deleted an entity that the current
session still holds in memory, while updating the snapshot identifier to the
new snapshot this entity needs to have the snapshot identifier nulled out,
making it a transient entity only. Developers may even expect these entities
and their links to become invisible. But currently we don't have a concept
for turning entities/links "invisible" or "invalid."</p>


Feature Tests
=====================================================================================
Feature tests are integration tests for individual TCS features
(e.g., properties, individual property arguments, operator templates...).

Feature tests are supposed to be minimal. They should only test one
specific bit of functionality at a time. The tests should serve as documentation
for the feature under test.

At a later point in time, these tests will also be used to test the pretty printer.



Scenario Tests
=====================================================================================
Scenario tests are integration tests that run complete example languages.



Integration Tests
=====================================================================================
Integration tests that do not fit into one of the other categories.

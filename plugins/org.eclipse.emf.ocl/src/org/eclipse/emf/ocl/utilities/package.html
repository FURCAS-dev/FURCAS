Abstract API for OCL AST utilities.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
This package defines a number of utility interfaces that are mixed in to the
AST model defined in the {@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.expressions} package.
These utilities provide services such as
{@linkplain org.eclipse.emf.ocl.utilities.Visitable visitor accept} protocol and
tracking from where in the source text an
{@linkplain org.eclipse.emf.ocl.utilities.ASTNode AST node} was parsed.  These
concerns are orthogonal to the definition of the abstract syntax model.
</p>

Extensions to the Ecore metamodel for UML-specific concepts supported by the
OCL language.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package extends the Ecore metamodel to support UML concepts required by
the OCL language that Ecore does not implement.  These extensions are not
required for the use of OCL on Ecore models, but would be necessary for other
metamodels that support some of these UML concepts.
</p>
<p>
The following Ecore extensions are defined:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.Constraint}:  top-level construct in
      the AST; contains an {@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.expressions.OCLExpression}
      in some constraint context.</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.CallOperationAction}:  represents an invocation
      of an {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EOperation} in the OCL message model.</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.SendSignalAction}:  represents the sending of
      a <code>Signal</code> in the OCL message model.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The {@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.helper.IOCLHelper} also provides simple, but
flexible, support for
parsing OCL expressions:  invariants in a classifier context, and pre/post
conditions and body conditions in an operation context.  Evaluation is also
supported for invariant constraints.  The helper is constructed with an
{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.parser.EnvironmentFactory} that creates the
necessary environments for parsing the client's metamodel.  This allows clients
of other metamodels than Ecore (e.g., SQL, UML2) that describe software
systems in terms of classifiers to use OCL to expression constraints.
An environment maps the metamodel in question to the OCL parser's extended
Ecore metamodel.
</p>

@deprecated Use the API in the {@link org.eclipse.ocl.ecore} package, instead.

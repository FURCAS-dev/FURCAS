Extensions to the Ecore metamodel for UML-specific concepts supported by the
OCL language.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package extends the Ecore metamodel to support UML concepts required by
the OCL language that Ecore does not implement.  These extensions are not
required for the use of OCL on Ecore models, but would be necessary for other
metamodels that support some of these UML concepts.  For example, a metamodel
describing SQL might map the intersection table of a many-to-many relationship
as an {@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.AssociationClass} rather than a
many-to-many {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EReference}, especially as it may
have additional columns (attributes) of its own.
</p>
<p>
The following Ecore extensions are defined:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.Operation}:  extends the
      {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EOperation} metaclass to add the
      <code>query</code> boolean attribute.  OCL constraints may be defined
      on any kind of operation, but may only invoke query operations (that are
      therefore guaranteed not to modify the system state).  This metaclass is
      useful to indicate which <code>EOperation</code>s are (not) queries.</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.Signal}:  extends the
      {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EClass} metaclass to indicate that a type
      corresponds to a UML Signal.  Only <code>Signal</code>s can be sent
      by OCL messages.</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.AssociationEnd}:  extends the
      {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EReference} metaclass represent a navigable
      end of a UML association.  This is most useful for association ends that
      have qualifiers, represented by {@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.Qualifier}s.
      For other associations, the <code>EReference</code> metaclass is sufficient
      to model the ends. <code>Qualifier</code>s have type, multiplicity,
      and ordering/uniqueness as do other
      {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.ETypedElement}s.</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.AssociationClassEnd}:  extends the
      {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EReference} metaclass represent a navigable
      end of a UML association class (rather than just an association).
      The <code>AssociationClassEnd</code> references the
      {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EClass} representing the association class, which
      is used to resolve the navigation to association classes (navigation being
      implied by the source's navigable association class ends).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The other types in this package model portions of the OCL abstract syntax tree,
not extending the Ecore language as such:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.Constraint}:  top-level construct in
      the AST; contains an {@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.expressions.OCLExpression}
      in some constraint context.</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.CallAction}:  represents an invocation
      of an {@link org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EOperation} in the OCL message model.</li>
  <li>{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.uml.SendAction}:  represents the sending of
      a <code>Signal</code> in the OCL message model.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The {@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.helper.IOCLHelper} also provides simple, but
flexible, support for
parsing OCL expressions:  invariants in a classifier context, and pre/post
conditions and body conditions in an operation context.  Evaluation is also
supported for invariant constraints.  The helper is constructed with an
{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.parser.EnvironmentFactory} that creates the
necessary environments for parsing the client's metamodel.  This allows clients
of other metamodels than Ecore (e.g., SQL, UML2) that describe software
systems in terms of classifiers to use OCL to expression constraints.
An environment maps the metamodel in question to the OCL parser's extended
Ecore metamodel.

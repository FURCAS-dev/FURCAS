Definition of the OCL Helper API for syntax completion support and a simplified
parsing model.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The primary interface in this package is the
{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.helper.IOclHelper}, which provides OCL syntax
completion assistance and parsing support.  Instances are obtained from the
{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.helper.HelperUtil} class.
</p>
<p>
OCL code completion suggestions are represented as
{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.helper.Choice}s, which indicate the text of a
language construct, a description, and the
{@linkplain org.eclipse.emf.ocl.helper.ChoiceType type} of construct.
</p>
<p>
The <code>IOclHelper</code> also provides simple, but flexible, support for
parsing OCL expressions:  invariants in a classifier context, and pre/post
conditions and body conditions in an operation context.  Evaluation is also
supported for invariant constraints.  The helper is constructed with an
{@link org.eclipse.emf.ocl.parser.EnvironmentFactory} that creates the
necessary environments for parsing the client's metamodel.  This allows clients
of other metamodels than Ecore (e.g., SQL, UML2) that describe software
systems in terms of classifiers to use OCL to expression constraints.
An environment maps the metamodel in question to the OCL parser's extended
Ecore metamodel.

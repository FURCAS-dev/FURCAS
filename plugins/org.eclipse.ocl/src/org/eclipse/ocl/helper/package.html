Definition of the OCL Helper API for syntax completion support and a simplified
parsing model for embedded OCL constraints and expressions.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The primary interface in this package is the
{@link org.eclipse.ocl.helper.OCLHelper}, which provides OCL syntax
completion assistance and parsing support.  Instances are obtained from the
{@link org.eclipse.ocl.OCL} class.
</p>
<p>
OCL code completion suggestions are represented as
{@link org.eclipse.ocl.helper.Choice}s, which indicate the name of a
language construct, a description, and the
{@linkplain org.eclipse.ocl.helper.ChoiceKind kind} of construct.
</p>
<p>
The <code>OCLHelper</code> also provides a simple API for parsing constraints
and expressions embedded in models:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>invariants and additional attribute/operation definitions in a
      classifier context</li>
  <li>pre/post conditions and body conditions in an operation context</li>
  <li>initial- and derived-value expressions in an attribute context</li>
</ul>
<p>
The helper also supports the simultaneous definition and value binding of
"global" variables, to support injection of custom variables into OCL
expressions.

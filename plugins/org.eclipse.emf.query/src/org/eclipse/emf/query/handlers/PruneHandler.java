/**
 * An abstract class that represents a prune handler. It is used by EObjectConditions 
 * to check if a given <code>EObject</code> has children -recursively- that are worth evaluating,
 * or, if all the contained EObjects for the given <code>EObject</code> will never satisfy the 
 * <code>EObjectCondition</code> at all, and hence there is no need to check them at all.
 * 
 * It is important for clients to know that 
 * pruning is treated as a hint only and is used solely to improve query performance
 * and should not be relied on for correctness of the <code>EObjectCondition</code> evaluation.
 * An <code>EObjectCondition</code> could not be consulted at all on pruning issue, and, its 
 * response -if it get consulted- might not be honoured by the query -especially
 * when having an <code>EObjectCondition</code> logically combined with another.
 * 
 * Clearly this <code>PruneHandler</code> is an <code>EObjectCondition</code> and a metamodel specific, and that's
 * why there is no default implementation other than the trivial cases of prune-always
 * or never-prune. <code>EObjectCondition</code> that use a <code>PruneHandler</code> usually default to using
 * the PruneHandler.NEVER so as to visit and evaluate every child in the <code>EObject</code> containment tree,
 * in this sense, providing a <code>PruneHandler</code> by clients is optional, nevertheless, it is 
 * there to allow clients to provide their own implementation as a way to enhance
 * performance of queries by not visiting useless branches.
 * 
 * This class is intended to be subclassed by clients.

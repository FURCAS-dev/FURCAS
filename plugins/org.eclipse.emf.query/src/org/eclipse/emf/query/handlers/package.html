 EMF Query Handlers
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package exposes the basic PruneHandler object that are used to help EObject related Conditions to prune the to-be-visited children tree.
</p>
<p>
PruneHandler object is used by EObjectConditions to check if a given EObject has children -recursively- that are worth evaluating,
or, if all the contained EObjects for the given EObject will never satisfy the EObjectCondition at all, and hence there is no need to check them at all.
PruneHandler objects could be viewed as a way to enahance performance of queries by not visiting useless barnches.
Clearly a PruneHandler is an EObjectCondition and a metamodel specific.

		<h1><a name="top">EMFT Query Overview</a></h1>
		<p>
			The query framework provides the basic infrastructure for specifying and executing
			queries against a set of EMF-Model elements and their contents. The following are the
			main classes to be used when formulating query statements:
			<ol>
				<li>
					The <code>IEObjectSource</code> interface provides the search scope elements to be used in a query.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>SELECT</code> class implements a template-function that does the iteration over model
					elements and applies the search condition on each; it collects the resulting elements
					into a <code>QueryResultSet</code> object and returns it to the caller.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>FROM</code> class represents the elements to search. It is responsible of providing
					an appropriate iterator for the elements in the search space.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>WHERE</code> class applies the search conditions over the elements in the search set.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>UPDATE</code> class passes the elements who satisfy the search condition to a caller-supplied
					modification function. It collects the modified elements into a QueryResultSet object
					and returns it to the caller.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>QueryResultSet</code> class represents the set of elements returned by a given query.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>EObjectCondition</code> class is the abstract parent of all conditions that deal with model-elements (i.e., EObjects).
					It incorporates the services of a PruneHandler in order to answers whether or not to prune the element
					tree at a specific element and thus ignore its children.
				</li> 
				<li>
					The <code>ConditionPolicy</code> class is used to allow the user to decide how to apply a given condition
					on a collection of a model-element <code>EAttributes</code> or <code>EReferences</code> values. Supports both the: exists (ANY) and
					for-all (ALL) semantics.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>EObjectStructuralFeatureValueCondition</code> class is the parent class for conditions that are responsible
					for checking the values held in model-elements' attributes or references. It uses the help of two other
					condition objects. The first is an EObjectCondition that it used to decide on the validity of
					context element (a context element is the model element whose attribute we are evaluating) and the other
					condition is an evaluator Condition that it uses to evaluate the value held in the attribute or the reference
					and whether or not it matches what the user is looking for.
				</li>
				<li>
					The framework provides OCL extensions to the EMF Query framework. It defines the interface <code>IOclQueryHelper</code> for performing
					OCL queries on EMF models. It supports Boolean-valued OCL expressions as query conditions that are used to formulate OCL
					queries over EMF models. The class <code>OclCondition</code> applies OCL expressions to <code>EObjects</code>. Allows the
					integration of OCL expressions with other <code>EObjectConditions</code>.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the above classes follow the steps described below to create and execute queries.
			<ol>
				<li>
					Create an implementation of the <code>IEObjectSource</code> interface.
				</li>
				<li>
					Extend the <code>EObjectCondition</code> class to define custom conditions or use one of the pre-defined conditions
					available as part of the query framework.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create a statement using the <code>SELECT</code> or <code>UPDATE</code> clauses.
				</li>
				<li>
					Execute the statement to produce the results.
				</li>
				<li>
					Check to ensure that the query did not generate any exceptions during its execution
				</li>
			</ol>

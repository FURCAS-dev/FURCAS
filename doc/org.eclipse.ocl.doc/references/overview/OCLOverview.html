		<h1>OCL Overview</h1>
		<p>
			The OCL framework provides the basic infrastructure for OCL constraint parsing and content assist for user models,
			OCL constraint validation and specifying OCL queries and conditions. The following are the
			main classes to be used with this framework:
			<ol>
				<li>
					OCL expressions are used for constructing, validating, and evaluating OCL queries and constraints on EMF model elements.
					The <code>QueryFactory</code> class will creates instances of the <code>Query</code> class. The syntax of the queries is implemented by the
					<code>OclExpression</code> class. For walking an OCL expression AST, see the <code>Visitor</code> interface.
				</li>
				<li>
					The framework provides support for OCL syntax completion and parsing on the meta-model and user model level. The primary
					interface is the <code>IOclHelper</code>, which provides OCL syntax completion assistance and parsing support. Instances of this
					interface are obtained from the <code>HelperUtil</code> class. OCL code completion suggestions are represented as <code>Choice</code> instances,
					which indicate the text of a language construct, a description, and the type of construct (<code>ChoiceType</code>).
				</li>
			</ol>

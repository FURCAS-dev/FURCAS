		<h1>Object Constraint Language Examples Overview</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The OCL examples use the extended library meta-model as the
			basis for demonstrating the capabilities. The intent of using the extended library meta-model is to
			help the user understand the capabilities applied to a simpler domain. This is the same
			meta-model used by the EMF team to demonstrate the EMF capabilities. The meta-model being
			used looks like the following in UML.

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			All the generated plugins related to the library model are installed automatically
			as part of the individual examples. The generated editor for the library model supports
			multi-rooted libraries. Most of the examples contribute menu items to the main menu and
			the context menu of the library editor to demonstrate their respective capabilities.

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
In this example you will
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create an Ecore model using the OCLinEcore text editor</li>
	<li>Create a dynamic instance of that Ecore model</li>
	<li>Enrich the Ecore model with OCL using the OCLinEcore text editor</li>
	<li>Validate the model and observe the OCL enrichments</li>
	<li>Use the OCL Console to execute the OCL enrichments</li>
</ul>
The above is all performed without generating any Java code;
the models exploit EMF's dynamic capabilities and the OCL integration.
<p>
You may then
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create an Ecore genmodel</li>
	<li>Generate Java code for the Ecore model that invokes the OCL expressions.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="installation">Installing the MDT/OCL Examples</a></h2>
<p>
The OCLinEcore editor is not part of the core OCL functionality included in the
Eclipse Modeling Tools Package, so although you may have OCL installed and be able
to read this tutorial via the <b>Help-&gt;HelpContents-&gt;OCL Developer Guide</b>, you may
not have the OCL examples installed.
</p>
<p>
An easy way to test whether you have the OCL Examples installed is
to right click on a <b>*.ecore</b> file and see whether <b>OCLinEcore (Ecore) Editor</b>
appears in the <b>Open With</b> submenu.
</p>
<p>
If OCL is not installed at all, or if just the examples are not installed,
the following installation step will automatically install the OCL Examples
and all required projects such as <b>EMF</b>, <b>UML2</b>, <b>MWE2</b>, <b>Xpand</b>
and <b>Xtext</b>.
</p>
<p>
Left-click on <b>Help</b> in the title-bar then left-click on <b>Install New Software...</b>
and select the <b>Helios - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios</b> update site
from the pull-down menu to <b>Work with</b> and be patient while the available updates
are identified. Then select <b>OCL Examples and Editors</b> from the <b>Modeling</b>
category.
</p>

<img src="install_software_bottom.png" alt="Install Software Bottom Half" />
<p>
Select <b>Next</b>.
</p>
<img src="install_details.png" alt="Install Details" />
<p>
Select <b>Next</b> again and read the license agreement. Set to accept it.
</p>
<img src="install_license.png" alt="Install License" />
<p>
Select <b>Finish</b> and be patient while the software is downloaded and installed.
Select <b>Restart Now</b> when prompted to do so.
</p>
<h2><a name="toubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p>
Eclipse Modeling Projects have a large number of classes and so require a
large amount of PermGen space on a Sun JVM. If you are using default Eclipse
startup settings you are liable to encounter OutOfMemoryExceptions. Therefore
follow the advice in
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ#How_do_I_start_Eclipse.3F">How do I start Eclipse</a>
and set XX:PermSize to at least 64M, either on your Eclipse command line, or your
Eclipse shortcut or in the <b>eclipse.ini</b> adjacent to <b>eclipse.exe</b>.
</p>
<p>
Beware that the editor is a very new example; there is validation of name references
but not of their types; this is work in progress. Sometimes spurious
errors are displayed, which may go away with a <b>Save</b>,
but may require an editor close and reopen. </p>

<h2><a name="ecore-editing">Using the OCLinEcore text editor for Ecore</a></h2>
<p>
There are many different (compatible) ways to create and edit Ecore models.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>An Ecore Model may be created from an XSD schema file</li>
	<li>An Ecore Model may be created from a Rose model file</li>
	<li>An Ecore Model may be created from annotated Java file</li>
	<li>The Sample Ecore Editor provides tree editing</li>
	<li>The Ecore Tools project provides graphical editing</li>
	<li>Papyrus provides UML editing that may be converted to Ecore</li>
</ul>
Here we introduce the OCLinEcore editor that provides text editing, which is
appropriate when a non-trivial amount of OCL enrichment is required.
<p>
All the above approaches update a <b>*.ecore</b> file, so the user is free to choose
whichever editing approach is best suited for the planned changes.
</p>
<h3><a name="new-project">Create a New EMF Project</a></h3>
<p>
We will first create a new project for this example; so invoke <b>File-&gt;New-&gt;Project...</b>
(left-click the <b>File</b> menu, then left-click <b>New</b>, then left-click <b>Project...</b>).
</p>
<p>
In the <b>New Project</b> dialog left-click to expand <b>Eclipse Modeling Framework</b>, then left-click to select
<b>Empty EMF Project</b>.
</p>
<img src="new_project.png" alt="New Project" />
<p>
Left-click on <b>Next</b> and in the <b>New Empty EMF Project</b> dialog type <b>Tutorial</b> as the project name.
</p>
<img src="new_empty_emf_project.png" alt="New Empty EMF Project" />
<p>
Left-click on <b>Finish</b>.
</p>

<h3><a name="new-model">Create a New Ecore Model</a></h3>
<p>
We will now create a new model for this example; so right-click on the <b>model</b> folder
in the <b>Tutorial</b> project to define the target folder and pop-up the context-sensitive menu
and select <b>New-&gt;Other...</b>.
</p>
<p>
In the <b>New</b> dialog left-click to expand <b>Eclipse Modeling Framework</b>, then left-click to select
<b>Ecore Model</b>.
</p>
<img src="new_ecore_model.png" alt="New Ecore Model" />
<p>
Left-click on <b>Next</b> and then in the <b>New Ecore Model</b> dialog type <b>Tutorial.ecore</b> as the file name.
</p>
<img src="new_ecore_model_dialog.png" alt="New Ecore Model Dialog" />
<p>
Left-click on <b>Finish</b>; The <b>Sample Ecore</b> editor for <b>Tutorial.ecore</b> opens showing a tree view of a single unnamed <tt>EPackage</tt>.
</p>
<img src="empty_ecore.png" alt="Empty Ecore Editor" />
<p>
Close the editor by left-clicking the cross on the editor tab.
</p>

<h3><a name="edit-model">Edit Ecore Model as OCLinEcore</a></h3>
<p>
We will now open the Ecore model using the OCLinEcore text editor and provide some
initial content.
</p>
<p>
Right-click on the <b>Tutorial.ecore</b> file to pop-up the context-sensitive menu
and select <b>Open With-&gt;OCLinEcore (Ecore) Editor</b>.
</p>
<p>
The first time you open a file in the project with one of the Xtext-based editors, you
will be asked
</p>
<img src="xtext_nature.png" alt="Xtext Nature Query" />
<p>
Click <b>Yes</b>
to avoid answering the question in the future.
</p>
<p>
An almost empty text file appears showing the package keyword and an empty name.
</p>
<img src="empty_oclinecore.png" alt="Empty OCLinEcore Editor" />
<p>
Now type (or cut and paste) the following text into the editor and save the file.</p>
<pre class="Code">
import ecore : 'http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#/';

package tutorial : tut = 'http://www.eclipse.org/mdt/ocl/oclinecore/tutorial'
{
  class Library
  {
    attribute name : String;
    property books#_'library' : Book[*] { composes };
    property loans : Loan[*] { composes };
    property members#_'library' : Member[*] { composes };
  }
  
  class Book
  {
    attribute name : String;
    attribute copies : Integer;
    property _'library'#books : Library;
  }
  
  class Member
  {
    attribute name : String;
    property _'library'#members : Library;
  }
  
  class Loan
  {
    property book : Book;
    property member : Member;
    attribute date : ecore::EDate;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
The syntax is fairly self explanatory, emulating OMG specifications with
'name : type[multiplicity] { properties }'.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><tt>import</tt> associates an alias with  an external EPackage.</li>
	<li><tt>package</tt> introduces an EPackage with name, nsPrefix and nsURI.</li>
	<li><tt>class</tt> introduces an EClass with name and optional superclasses.</li>
	<li><tt>attribute</tt> introduces a property with a datatype type (an EAttribute).</li>
	<li><tt>property</tt> introduces a property with a class type (an EReference).</li>
	<li><tt>#</tt> introduces an opposite role name.</li>
	<li><tt>_'xxx'</tt> escapes an awkward or reserved word identifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The import URI is the URI of a Package, so in the example the <tt>http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore</tt>
is the URI of the model, <tt>#</tt> is the fragment separator and <tt>/</tt> is the path to
the Package at the root of the XMI document.
</p>
<p>
Completion assist (Ctrl Space) may be used for syntax assistance.
</p>
<p>In order to discover a syntax for which completion assist is insufficient,
you may use the Sample Ecore Editor on a test file to create the kind of Ecore element
that you require, and then open the test file with the OCLinEcore editor to see the
corresponding textual syntax.
</p>

<h3><a name="tutorial-meta-model">The Tutorial Meta-Model</a></h3>
<p>
The example meta-model models a library with members and books
and loans of books to members. It may be viewed graphically using the Ecore Tools
(not part of this tutorial).
</p>
<img src="ecore_diagram.png" alt="Ecore Diagram" />
<p>
The OCL types <tt>String</tt> and <tt>Integer</tt> map
to <tt>EString</tt> and <tt>EBigInteger</tt> in Ecore.
</p>

<p class="small">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="create-model">Create a Dynamic Model Instance</a></h2>
<p>
At this point a corresponding EMF tutorial would show how to generate Java code for
the meta-model and for an editor for the meta-model. Here we are concerned with modeling, so we will 
continue with the models alone.
</p>
<p>
In the outline, right-click on <b>Library</b> to show the context-sensitive menu
and then left-click on <b>Create Dynamic Instance...</b> to start to create a
new Dynamic Model with <tt>Library</tt> at its root.
</p>
<p>
(If the Outline is not visible, it may be made visible by <b>Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Outline</b>.)
</p>
<p>
(If <tt>Library</tt> is not visible in the Outline, left-click on <b>OCLinEcore Document</b>
to expand it, then on <b>tutorial</b> to expand it.)
</p>
<img src="create_dynamic_instance.png" alt="Create Dynamic Instance" />
<p>
In the <b>Create Dynamic Instance</b> dialog select <b>Tutorial/model</b> as
the parent folder for the <b>Tutorial.xmi</b> dynamic model instance and left-click <b>Finish</b>.
</p>
<img src="create_dynamic_instance_dialog.png" alt="Create Dynamic Instance Dialog" />
<p>
The model is automatically opened for editing using the Sample Reflective Ecore Editor,
which gives a tree-like presentation of the model. The properties of each node can
be seen in the Properties View.
</p>
<img src="initial_model.png" alt="Initial Model" />
<p>
(If the Properties View is not visible, right-click within the editor and left-click on
<b>Show Properties View</b>.)
</p>
<p>
From the right-button menu for <tt>Library</tt> use <b>New Child-&gt;Books Book</b> twice,
use <b>New Child-&gt;Loans Loan</b> once and <b>New Child-&gt;Members Member</b> three times
to populate the model with two books, one loan and three members. 
</p>
<p>
Left-click to select each of the Books and Members in turn and enter a name
such as <tt>b1</tt> or <tt>m2</tt> using the Properties View. Specify that b1
has one copy and that b2 has 2 copies.
</p>
<img src="model_copies.png" alt="Model Showing Copies" />
<p>
The books and members now have distinct titles in the outline. 
When you left-click to select the Loan and edit its Book and Member attributes,
the associated pull-down has meaningful entries. Specify that the Loan is for
<tt>b2</tt> by <tt>m3</tt>.
</p>
<img src="model_pull_down.png" alt="Model Pull-Down Menu" />
<p>
The configuration so far is simple, three members, two books and one loan. We can
validate that this by right-clicking on the <tt>Library</tt> node, and left-clicking
to <b>Validate</b> <tt>Library</tt> and all its children.
</p>
<img src="validate_menu.png" alt="Validate Menu" />
<p>
Since the model is so simple, it is difficult to have anything wrong; most of
the illegal modeling options such as a Loan composing rather than referencing a
Book are prevented by the Editor's enforcement of the meta-model.
</p>
<img src="validation_successful.png" alt="Validation Successful" />
<p>
(If you have an error at this point, a <b>Details</b> button will lead you to some
diagnostics that may clarify the problem. Pasting the following XMI should also
resolve an entry problem.)
</p>
<pre class="Code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ASCII"?&gt;
&lt;tut:Library xmi:version="2.0" xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xmlns:tut="http://www.eclipse.org/mdt/ocl/oclinecore/tutorial"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.eclipse.org/mdt/ocl/oclinecore/tutorial Tutorial.ecore"&gt;
  &lt;books name="b1" copies="1"/&gt;
  &lt;books name="b2" copies="2"/&gt;
  &lt;loans book="//@books.1" member="//@members.2"/&gt;
  &lt;members name="m1"/&gt;
  &lt;members name="m2"/&gt;
  &lt;members name="m3"/&gt;
&lt;/tut:Library&gt;
</pre>

<p>
We will now create two further identical loans of <tt>b2</tt> by <tt>m3</tt>. This
may conveniently be performed by left-clicking to select the existing loan,
typing Ctrl-C to copy it, left-clicking to select the <tt>Library</tt> as the new parent,
then typing Ctrl-V to paste it on the library. Repeat so that there are three
identical loans.
</p>
<p>
Validating the library should still be successful, although it is clearly wrong for
the two copies of <tt>b2</tt> to participate in three loans.
</p>

<p class="small">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="enrich-meta-model">Enrich the meta-model with OCL</a></h2>
<p>
The semantic constraint that a book cannot be borrowed more times than there are books
is a simple example of a constraint that cannot be expressed by simple multiplicities; 
a more powerful capability is required that may potentially require evaluation
of functions of almost arbitrary complexity. The Object Constraint Language
provides this capability.
</p>
<p>
The constraint can be realized as an invariant on a book that specifies that
that (the size of the (selection of loans involving the book)) is less than or equal
to (the number of copies of the book).
</p>
<p>
Close the <b>Tutorial.xmi</b> editor before modifying its meta-model. (Beware that
a wide variety of unpleasant errors can occur if the meta-model is changed after
the model is loaded.)</p>
<p>
Add the invariant shown below to the meta-model.
</p>
<pre class="Code">
  class Book
  {
    invariant SufficientCopies:
      library.loans-&gt;select(book=self)-&gt;size() &lt;= copies;
    attribute name : String;
    attribute copies : Integer;
    property library#books : Library;
  }
</pre>
<p>
The required semantic is expressed by the <tt>SufficientCopies</tt> invariant constraint for a Book.
For a valid model the SufficientCopies invariant must always be true.
</p>
<p>
If you reopen the <b>Tutorial.xmi</b> editor and invoke <b>Validate</b> for the <tt>Library</tt>,
you will now get a validation error. Left click <b>Details</b> for details.
</p>
<img src="validation_unsuccessful.png" alt="Validation Unsuccessful" />
<p>
The <b>Details</b> identifies that the <tt>SufficientCopies</tt> invariant is not
satisfied for the <tt>b2</tt> book. 
</p>
<p>
If you now change the first loan so that <tt>b1</tt> is borrowed and then validate
again, the problem is resolved. It is alright for <tt>m3</tt> to borrow
the one copy of <tt>b1</tt> and the two copies of <tt>b2</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Before introducing a further constraint of no duplicate loans, we will show
how OCL expressions can be exercised. OCL is a very powerful compact language;
the example hides a loop over all the loans. More complex examples may easily
involve three or four levels of hidden loops on a single line, but may equally
easily have simple errors. It is therefore helpful to simplify expressions
and use helper operations and properties to modularise them. These may then be
exercised using the OCL Console.
</p>

<p class="small">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="console">The OCL Console</a></h2>
<p>
The OCL Console supports interactive execution of an OCL expression in the
context of a model instance.
</p>
<p>
To make the OCL Console visible, first make the <b>Console</b> view visible by
<b>Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Console</b>. Then right click on the <b>Open Console</b> and
left click on <b>Interactive OCL</b>.
</p>
<img src="ocl_console_menu.png" alt="OCL Console menu" />
<p>
Alternatively, you can just invoke <b>Show OCL Console</b> from the right button menu
within the <b>Sample Ecore Editor</b> or <b>Sample Reflective Ecore Editor</b>.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Interactive OCL</b> console comprises two main text panes. The upper pane
displays results. The lower pane supports entry of queries.
</p>
<p>
Left-click to select the <tt>Library</tt> in the <b>Tutorial.xmi</b> as the context
for a query, and then type <tt>books</tt> followed by a new line into the lower
pane of the console. 
</p>
<p>
The result of evaluating this query for the Library is shown.
</p>
<img src="books_query.png" alt="Books Query" />
<p>
Substantial OCL queries spanning many lines may be entered and so the cursor up
and cursor down keys move across lines. If you want to access an earlier query,
you may use the <b>Page Up</b> or <b>Page Down</b> keys to save typing them again.
</p>
<p>
You can examine the execution of the earlier query by selecting each of the books
in turn and executing <tt>library.loans-&gt;select(book=self)</tt>, to see that <tt>b1</tt>
has one Loan and <tt>b2</tt> two.
</p>
<p>
(Practising queries in this way is particularly important with MDT/OCL 3.0.0 since
validation of expression types is not performed in the editor. You may therefore
enter erroneous OCL without warning from the editor and get an OclInvalid
result from execution. Step-wise practice can resolve this. The next MDT/OCL
release will have this missing validation.)
</p>

<p class="small">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="helpers">Helper Features and Operations</a></h2>
<p>
We will now introduce some helper attributes and operations to make
the OCL clearer and provide a richer meta-model API.
Close the <b>Tutorial.xmi</b> editor and modify the meta-model to include
the derived <tt>loans</tt> property and the helper operation <tt>isAvailable()</tt>.
Simplify the invariant to use the derived property.
</p>
<pre class="Code">
  class Book
  {
    invariant SufficientCopies: 
      loans-&gt;size() &lt;= copies;
    attribute name : String[?];
    attribute copies : Integer[?];
    property loans : Loan[*] { derived,volatile }
    {
      derivation: library.loans-&gt;select(book=self);
    }
    property _'library'#books : Library[?];
    operation isAvailable() : Boolean[?]
    {
      body: loans-&gt;size() &lt; copies;
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>
Note that the derived property must also be volatile to avoid problems when
a model is loaded but has no content.
</p>
<p>
The derived property is visible in the <b>Properties</b> view.
</p>
<img src="derived_property.png" alt="Derived Property" />
<p>
The helper operation can be evaluated in the <b>Console</b> view by selecting book <tt>b2</tt> and typing <tt>isAvailable()</tt> for execution.
</p>
<img src="helper_operation.png" alt="Helper Operation" />

<p>
We will now add further helpers and constraints to enforce an
at most two loans per member policy and to require loans to be unique.
</p>
<p>
(Don't forget to close <b>Tutorial.xmi</b> while changing its meta-model.)
</p>
<pre class="Code">  class Member
  {
    invariant AtMostTwoLoans: 
      loans-&gt;size() &lt;= 2;
    invariant UniqueLoans: 
      loans-&gt;isUnique(book);
    attribute name : String[?];
    property _'library'#members : Library[?];
    property loans : Loan[*] { derived,volatile }
    {
      derivation: library.loans-&gt;select(member=self);
    }
    property books : Book[*] { derived,volatile,!unique }
    {
      derivation: loans-&gt;collect(book);
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>
The additional <tt>books</tt> property may be evaluated in the OCL
Console to show which books each member has on loan. The property may also be seen in the <b>Properties</b> view. 
</p>
<p>
Select the library again and invoke <b>Validate</b> from the right button menu.
There are now two validation failures. 
</p>
<img src="two_validation_errors.png" alt="Two Validation Errors" />

<p class="small">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="java-code">Generating Java Code</a></h2>
<p>
We have shown how OCL may be used to enrich Ecore meta-models, how model instances can be created
and validated and how expressions can be evaluated, all without generating any Java code.
</p>
<p>
Exactly the same facilities are available if you do generate Java code and as a result you gain some speed
benefits. In the MDT/OCL 3.0.0 (Helios) release the generated Java code for OCL is
interpreted and so the speed gains occur only for the EMF models. In a future release,
the OCL will be converted to Java giving significant speed improvements.
</p>
<p>
Generating Java code is exactly the same as for any other EMF project; with one important
difference; you must set <b>Operation Reflection</b>
to true.
</p>
<p>
Select the <b>Tutorial.ecore</b> file and invoke <b>New-&gt;Other...</b> from the right button menu
and select <b>Eclipse Modeling Framework</b> and <b>EMF Generator Model</b>.
</p>
<img src="new_emf_generator.png" alt="New EMF Generator" />
<p>
Select <b>Next</b>.
</p>
<img src="new_emf_generator_model.png" alt="New EMF Generator Model" />
<p>
Select <b>Next</b>.
</p>
<img src="new_emf_generator_model_ecore.png" alt="New EMF Generator Model for Ecore" />
<p>
Select <b>Next</b>.
</p>
<img src="new_emf_generator_model_load.png" alt="New EMF Generator Model Load" />
<p>
Select <b>Load</b> and <b>Next</b>.
</p>
<img src="new_emf_generator_model_packages.png" alt="New EMF Generator Model Packages" />
<p>
Select <b>Finish</b>.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Tutorial.genmodel</b> editor opens.
</p>
<img src="gen_model.png" alt="Gen Model" />
<p>
Most of the default settings are suitable. The one that is not is highlighted. Select the
root <b>Tutorial</b> and scroll down the <b>Properties</b> view and set <b>Operation Reflection</b>
to true.
</p>
<p>
You may now invoke <b>Generate Model Code</b> from the right button menu of either <b>Tutorial</b>
to generate Java models that invoke OCL.
</p>
<img src="gen_model_menu.png" alt="Gen Model" />

<p class="small">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="java-details">Java Details</a></h3>
<p>
You can check that the OCL appears in your Java by looking at <b>TutorialValidator.java</b>
where you'll find the OCL expression as a String awaiting compilation at run-time, and
the validate invocation that triggers that compilation and execution.

Similarly in <b>BookImpl</b> you will find the declaration of a cached delegate and
the dynamic invocation that provokes the first time compilation.
</p>
<pre>
protected static final EOperation.Internal.InvocationDelegate IS_AVAILABLE__EINVOCATION_DELEGATE = ((EOperation.Internal)TutorialPackage.Literals.BOOK___IS_AVAILABLE).getInvocationDelegate();
</pre>
<pre>
public boolean isAvailable() {
	try {
		return (Boolean)IS_AVAILABLE__EINVOCATION_DELEGATE.dynamicInvoke(this, null);
	}
	catch (InvocationTargetException ite) {
		throw new WrappedException(ite);
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
The OCL expression for the invocation delegate may be found in <b>TutorialPackageImpl.createOCLAnnotations()</b>.
</p>
<pre>
addAnnotation
  (getBook__IsAvailable(), 
   source, 
   new String[] {
	 "body", "loans-&gt;size() &lt; copies"
   });

<h3><a name="api-invariants">API Invariants</a></h3>
<p>
The invariants we have used so far do not contribute to the class API.
</p>
<p>
If you want to have fine grain control of which validations are performed,
perhaps because in some incremental context not all are appropriate, you
may use the operation form of an invariant. 
</p>
<pre>
  class Book
  {
    operation sufficientCopies(diagnostics : ecore::EDiagnosticChain,
      context : ecore::EMap&lt;ecore::EJavaObject,ecore::EJavaObject&gt;) : Boolean
    {
	  body: library.loans-&gt;select(book=self)-&gt;size() &lt;= copies;
    }
    attribute name : String;
    attribute copies : Integer;
    property library#books : Library;
  }
</pre>
<p>
Note that the operation must have a Boolean return (true for valid) and
diagnostics and context arguments.

<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>
To illustrate how to work with the OCL and Ecore as models we have
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Created an Ecore meta-model using the OCLinEcore text editor</li>
	<li>Created a dynamic model instance from that meta-model</li>
	<li>Enriched the meta-model with embedded OCL</li>
	<li>Used the embedded OCL while validating the model</li>
	<li>Queried the model usng the Interactive OCL Console.</li>
	<li>Evaluated OCL embedded in the meta-model in the Console.</li>
</ol>
<p>
To use OCL and Ecore as generated Java models we have
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Generated Java that exploits the embedded OCL.</li>
</ol>

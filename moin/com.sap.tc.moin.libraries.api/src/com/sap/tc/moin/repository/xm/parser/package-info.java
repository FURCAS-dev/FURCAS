/**
 * MOIN XML Mapping API for the XM Parser.
 * <p>
 * The XM Parser uses mainly a generated handler which handles SAX like events
 * during the parsing of an XML document (see class XmParserHandlerAbstract).
 * The generated handler can be adapted to the need of the developer. This
 * package provides helper methods which the XML mapping developer can use for
 * his adaption (see interface ParserHelper).
 * <p>
 * This API is for SAP-internal use only and subject to change.

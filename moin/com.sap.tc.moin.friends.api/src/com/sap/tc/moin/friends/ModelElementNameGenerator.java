    /**
     * Builds a name according to the MOIN recommendation on model element names
     * from a list of words. The only deviation from MOF is, that white spaces
     * are not allowed.
     * <p>
     * The following operations are executed on each word:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the word contains a character which is neither a digit nor a
     * letter nor an underscore, then the character is removed</li>
     * <li>Non 7-bit ASCII characters are removed</li>
     * <li>If the first character is a letter, the character is put to upper
     * case</li>
     * </ul>
     * Afterwards the words are concatenated. If this results in an empty name,
     * null is returned. If it results in a name that does not start with a
     * letter, the optional prefix <code>prefix</code> is set before the name.
     * <p>
     * The prefix has to be a valid MOIN name. Is it taken as it is, especially
     * its first character is not put to upper case.
     * <p>
     * Examples:
     * <table border = "1">
     * <tr>
     * <th><b>Word list</b></th>

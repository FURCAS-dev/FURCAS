 * Provides information about available metamodels. <br>
 * MOIN metamodel is delivered as platform-dependent archive, e.g. Eclipse
 * plug-in in IDE scenario and JS SDA in JS scenario and the metamodel
 * deployment is a scenario-specific functionality. Therefore the metamodel
 * catalog and metamodel info provides scenario-independent view to the
 * installed metamodel and are used internally by MOIN core to access metamodel
 * artifacts. <br>

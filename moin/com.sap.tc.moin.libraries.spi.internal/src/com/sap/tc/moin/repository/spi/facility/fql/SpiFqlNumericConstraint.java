     * <ul>
     * <li> int, long, float, double: all operations are permitted with the
     * expected semantics
     * <li> boolean: only the operation EQUAL is permitted with the expected

     * that an empty string is a legal value for a comparison. In addition, we
     * have the following restrictions:
     * <ul>
     * <li> LIMITATION 1: a comparison for a string-typed attribute does not
     * allow a string constant which is longer than 200 characters. Moreover, if
     * the stored attribute has more than 200 characters, only the first 200
     * characters are considered in the comparison.
     * <li> LIMITATION 2: a string attribute comparison does not allow the
     * string constant to have trailing blanks. For example, it is not allowed
     * to compare with 'myStr '. Moreover, the comparison happens modulo
     * trailing blanks for <i>stored</i> attributes (it is possible to persist
     * strings with trailing blanks in MOIN). For example, the comparison attr =
     * 'myStr' will be true if attr is 'myStr' <i>or</i> 'myStr '.
